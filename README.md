In this Github, we save the Gaia eDR3 source IDs of the Nyx stream stars that pass the strongest cuts, with the neural network cut S > 0.95, and a probability to belong to the Gaussian distribution of the Nyx stream higher than 95%. These stars are discussed in details in the paper above. 

[This paper](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/04/aa36866-19/aa36866-19.html) by Bryan Ostdiek et al. built the neural network and applied it to Gaia DR2, to build an accreted stellar catalog that can be found here. 

[This paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abb814) by Lina Necib et al. analyzes the different structures in the accreted catalog.
